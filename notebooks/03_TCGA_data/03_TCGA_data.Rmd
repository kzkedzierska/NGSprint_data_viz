# Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, dpi = 300)
```


Run if you don't have the packages installed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# a helper abbreviation
`%not in%` <- Negate(`%in%`)

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

needed_packages <- 
  c("recount3", "maftools", "DESeq2", "TCGAbiolinks", "biomaRt")

for (pkg in needed_packages) {
  if (pkg %not in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
    print(paste("Trying to install", pkg))
    BiocManager::install(pkg)
    if ((pkg %not in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
      msg <- paste("ERROR: Unsuccessful!", pkg, "not installed!",
                   "Check the log and try installing the package manually.")
      stop(msg)
    } 
  }
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  ifelse(pkg %in% loadedNamespaces(), 
         print(paste("Successful!", pkg, "loaded.")),
         print(paste("ERROR: Unsuccessful!", pkg, 
                     "not loaded. Check error msg.")))
}

pkg <- "InteractiveComplexHeatmap"
if (pkg %not in% installed.packages()) {
  print(paste("Trying to install", pkg))
  remotes::install_github("jokergoo/InteractiveComplexHeatmap", 
                          upgrade = "always")
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  ifelse(pkg %in% loadedNamespaces(), 
         print(paste("Successful!", pkg, "loaded.")),
         print(paste("ERROR: Unsuccessful!", pkg, 
                     "not loaded. Check error msg.")))
}
```

Load all the packages and define functions.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# for unified and processed RNA-seq data
library(recount3)
# to normalize the RNA-seq data 
library(DESeq2) 
# for access to TCGA data
library(TCGAbiolinks)
# to look at the data
library(tidyverse)
# to visualize the mutation data
library(maftools)
# to create heatmaps
library(ComplexHeatmap)

scale2 <- function(mat, ...) {
  t(scale(t(mat), ...))
}
```

# Gene expression

## Preparing the data

Using `recount3` we download the data for a Lower Grade Glioma (**LGG**). In order to read more about the package and explore more of its function, refer to the [manual](http://research.libd.org/recount3/index.html) and [quick guide](http://research.libd.org/recount3/articles/recount3-quickstart.html).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rse_gene <- 
  create_rse(
    subset(
      available_projects(),
      project == "LGG" & project_type == "data_sources"
    )
  )
```

Now, let's explore what are we looking at?

```{r}
assayNames(rse_gene)
```
We need to scale the reads to be able to use them in `DESeq2` processing.

```{r}
assay(rse_gene, "counts") <- 
  transform_counts(rse_gene)
```

The attached colData contains a lot of information that we can use on top of the expression data. 

```{r}
sample_sheet <-
  colData(rse_gene) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("sample_id")

sample_sheet %>%
  head(n = 3)
```
For plotting, we will use the variance stabilizing transformation (**vst**) normalized counts (as it is quicker than **rlog**). To read more about normalization, please read [Data transformations and visualization](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#data-transformations-and-visualization) section of RNA-seq data anlysis guide from Bioconductor.

```{r}
normalized_counts <- 
  vst(assays(rse_gene)$counts)
```

```{r}
normalized_counts[1:5, 1:2]
```


Now, to simplify our analyses we want to have a) only Tumor Samples (unless you decide otherwise) and b) one sample per patient in the data set. 


```{r}
sample_sheet_one <-
  sample_sheet %>%
  filter(tcga.cgc_sample_sample_type == "Primary Tumor") %>%
  mutate(patient_id = str_extract(tcga.tcga_barcode, 
                                "[^-]{4}-[^-]{2}-[^-]{4}")) %>%
  group_by(patient_id) %>%
  # this is quick, but dirty way to take just one repeat per patient
  sample_n(1) 

# select only the samples we want to keep
normalized_counts <-
  normalized_counts[ ,  sample_sheet_one$sample_id]

# change rownames to nice patient ids
colnames(normalized_counts) <- sample_sheet_one$patient_id

normalized_counts[156:159, 1:2]
```

## Sample distances heatmap

Let's calculate the variance between the genes, it will come in handy when we would like to narrow down the analyses to the most variable subset of genes.

```{r}
row_var <-
  rowVars(normalized_counts)
```

Let's look at the sample distances - can we see some clustering?

First, let's calculate the distances between our samples. For the sake of speed we will only take top 35% of genes.

```{r}
samples_dist <- dist(t(normalized_counts[row_var > quantile(row_var, 0.75),]))
```

And now, let's see the sample distances. For that we will use heatmap. A heatmap is a visualization of a matrix in which each cell is colored according to its value. 

```{r}
Heatmap(as.matrix(samples_dist), 
        show_row_names = FALSE, 
        show_column_names = FALSE, 
        col = viridis::mako(100), 
        show_row_dend = FALSE)
```

We can see that there are some samples with high and low similarity, meaning that we can see some organization in our data.

## Gene expression heatmap

Now, let's generate the heatmap showing expression of different genes. For that purpose, we select top 1% of highly variable genes.

In here, the rows are genes and the columns are samples, meaning that each cell represents an expression value for a given gene in a given sample. In this heatmap, we visualized scaled values - meaning we subtracted the mean and dived by standard deviation. Scaling allows us to focus on the changes in expression between samples, regardless of absolute levels of expression of particular genes.

```{r}
ht <-
  Heatmap(scale2(normalized_counts[row_var > quantile(row_var, 0.99),]),
        show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE,
        clustering_distance_rows = "pearson", name = "gene expression",
        col = viridis::viridis(100), use_raster = TRUE)

ht
```

Those heatmap need some work - we need to add more information coming from additional data sources. But first, let see what type of data we have access to.


# Somatic mutations

We will now use the great `TCGAbiolinks` package that help accessing the vast data source of TCGA. Read more about this great package [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/index.html).

Because of the unexpected maintenance of the GDC server we will have to use other means to download the mutations data. For that we will use the `maftools::tcgaLoad` function. Note that that function comes with the v2.8 version, the code below should tell you if you need to install the package. 

Note2: This maf from `maftools::tcgaLoad` is generated based on the hg19 genome, while the `TCGAbiolinks::GDCquery_Maf` you could choose hg38 or hg19 (on default it downloaded the hg38). 


```{r maf, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
maf <-
  GDCquery_Maf("LGG", pipelines = "mutect2", directory = "../GDCdata") %>%
  read.maf(verbose = TRUE)

# now that GDC works again, we don't need this
# 
# tryCatch(maf <- tcgaLoad(study = "LGG"), 
#          error = function(e) {
#            print(paste(rep("#", 50), collapse = ""))
#            print(paste0("# ERROR! Read the message below!", 
#                         paste(rep(" ", 17), collapse = ""),
#                         "#"))
#            print(paste(rep("#", 50), collapse = ""))
#            print(e)
#            print(paste("If you're seeing this message you probably don't have",
#                        "maftools package loaded, or have an older version.", 
#                        "This function is available with v2.8.",
#                        "Install the new version of maftools package with",
#                        "`BiocManager::install('PoisonAlien/maftools')`", 
#                        "and try again!"))
#            })
```

First thing we can do is the mutation specific summary - what kind of mutations do we have in a sample? For that we will use functions from another great package - `maftools` a dedicated package to visualize maf data. You can see what brilliant things the package does and what things you can easily investigate [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/maftools/inst/doc/maftools.html).

```{r}
plotmafSummary(maf = maf, rmOutlier = TRUE, 
               addStat = 'median', dashboard = TRUE, 
               log_scale = TRUE)

```
First thing we see is that this cancer type does not have many mutations. We can compare it with other TCGA cancer types. 

```{r}
tcga_mutation_burden <- 
  tcgaCompare(maf = maf, cohortName = "LGG")
```

We can see that LGG is one of the less mutated cancers. 

Now, we can look at the top mutated genes.

```{r}
oncoplot(maf = maf, top = 10)
```
*IDH1* is by far the most mutated gene - are mutations in that gene in one hotspot or distributed? Let's visualize the mutations in this gene. 

```{r}
lollipopPlot(maf, "IDH1", labelPos = 'all')
```
Clearly the R132 position is a hotspot, mutated in more than 3/4 of the samples!

The case is not so clear with TP53.

```{r}
lollipopPlot(maf, "TP53")
```

If we would annotate all the mutations on the TP53 lolliplot we wouldn't be able to read anything, so we need to subset the positions.

```{r}
top_label <-
  maf@data %>%
  filter(Hugo_Symbol == "TP53") %>%
  group_by(HGVSp_Short) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  pull(HGVSp_Short) %>%
  str_extract("[0-9]+")

lollipopPlot(maf, "TP53", labelPos = top_label, labPosAngle = 20)
```

Similarly to TP53, *ATRX* is mutated at different positions rather than in one hotspot. Interestingly, this gene is enriched for Frameshift and Nonsense mutations.

```{r}
lollipopPlot(maf, "ATRX")
```

We can also look at the cooccurences and mutual exclusivity - which genes are frequently mutated together? Which aren't?

```{r}
somaticInteractions(maf, top = 15, pvalue = c(0.01, 0.05))
```

# Clinical data 

With the `recount3` data comes clinical information as well. For example, we can check the sex or ethnicity of the patients with `tcga.gdc_cases.demographic.` columns. 

```{r}
sample_sheet %>%
  select(starts_with("tcga.gdc_cases.demographic."))
```
There's much more data in that dataframe - after all there are almost a thousand columns. However that's only the data for samples in the expression matrix.

We can also access additional data from `TCGAbiolinks`, for example we can see in what subtypes were the samples separated into. This data will cover more patients - including those which samples were whole exome sequenced, but have no expression data and so on.

```{r}
tcga_subtype_data <-
  TCGAquery_subtype(tumor = "lgg")

tcga_subtype_data %>%
  select(ends_with("subtype"))
```

The dataframe contains much more data, and the function prints out information about the publication the data comes from. 

```{r}
tcga_subtype_data
```


Now that we have information of a subtype (and other), we can add it to our heatmap.

```{r}
top_annotation_df <-
  tcga_subtype_data %>%
  select(patient, Histology, Original.Subtype, Transcriptome.Subtype) %>%
  column_to_rownames("patient")

# make sure we are taking only information about samples in RNA-seq expression
top_annotation_df <-
  top_annotation_df[colnames(normalized_counts),]

# prepare colors, cause random ones are bad
# I generate those pallets  https://colorbrewer2.org/
histology_cols <- c(astrocytoma = "#d8b365",  
                    oligodendroglioma ="#99d8c9", 
                    oligoastrocytoma = "#2ca25f")

original_cols <- c("IDHmut-non-codel" = "#fee8c8",
                   "IDHwt" = "#fdbb84",
                   "IDHmut-codel" = "#e34a33")

transcriptome_cols <- c("CL" = "#7b3294", 
                        "ME" = "#c2a5cf", 
                        "NE" = "#a6dba0", 
                        "PN" = "#008837")
# create annotation
ha <-
  HeatmapAnnotation(df = top_annotation_df, 
                    which = "column", 
                    col = list("Histology" = histology_cols,
                               "Original.Subtype" = original_cols,
                               "Transcriptome.Subtype" = transcriptome_cols), 
                    na_col = "#999999")

Heatmap(as.matrix(samples_dist), 
        show_row_names = FALSE, 
        show_column_names = FALSE, 
        col = viridis::mako(100), 
        show_row_dend = FALSE, 
        top_annotation = ha)
```

And let's see the transciptome heatmap with added annotation. Interestingly, even by selecting only top 1% we can see that different Transcriptome Subtypes are clustering together.

```{r}
ht <-
  Heatmap(scale2(normalized_counts[row_var > quantile(row_var, 0.99),]),
        show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE,
        clustering_distance_rows = "pearson", name = "gene expression",
        col = viridis::viridis(100), use_raster = TRUE, top_annotation = ha)

ht
```


# What next?

You can do much more with those data - firstly, you can draw inspiration from the vignettes of the packages. Secondly, you can see what is interesting to you, what you would want to know? Thirdly, this is already published data and you can always refer to the paper - maybe there are some figures you have an idea to improve?

Few ideas from the top of my head:
* improve the heatmap by adding the subtype, sex and other variable annotations. Add the mutation in various top genes as annotations at the bottom;
* reduce dimensionality of expression data with PCA or tSNE and see if you see the subtypes specific from transcriptome data
* access the survival data and see how they separate based on the subtype;
* visualize point mutations on the protein (for example [here](https://michelanglo.sgc.ox.ac.uk/))

For example, in order to add IDH1 annotation, we need to join the information from two dataframes (one that has unique column ids and one that has the information about mutation).

```{r}
idh1_mutation <-
  maf@data %>%
  mutate(patient_id = str_extract(Tumor_Sample_Barcode, 
                                  "[^-]{4}-[^-]{2}-[^-]{4}")) %>%
  select(Hugo_Symbol, patient_id) %>%
  filter(Hugo_Symbol == "IDH1") %>%
  column_to_rownames("patient_id")

ha_bottom <-
  idh1_mutation[colnames(normalized_counts), , drop = FALSE] %>%
  rownames_to_column("patient_id") %>%
  mutate(present = ifelse(is.na(Hugo_Symbol), FALSE, TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(patient_id) %>%
  summarise(IDH1 = any(present)) %>%
  column_to_rownames("patient_id") %>%
  HeatmapAnnotation(df = ., col = list("IDH1" = c(`TRUE` = "black", 
                                                  `FALSE` = "white")))
```

When we have the annotation, we can add it to the plot.

```{r}
ht3 <-
  Heatmap(scale2(normalized_counts[row_var > quantile(row_var, 0.99),]),
        show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE,
        clustering_distance_rows = "pearson", name = "gene expression",
        col = viridis::viridis(100), 
        top_annotation = ha, bottom_annotation = ha_bottom)

ht3
```

# Interactive plot

With using just one package and one command, we can make an interactive plot.

But before this, I want to translate the ensembl ids to hugo gene symbol to improve readability. 

```{r}
ensembl_ids <- 
  rownames(normalized_counts) %>%
  str_remove("\\.[0-9]*")

mart <- biomaRt::useMart("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
ensembl_to_hgnc <-
  biomaRt::getBM(attributes = c('ensembl_gene_id', 'hgnc_symbol'), 
                 mart = mart) %>%
  filter(ensembl_gene_id %in% ensembl_ids) %>%
  group_by(ensembl_gene_id) %>%
  summarise(hgnc_symbol = paste(unique(hgnc_symbol)[unique(hgnc_symbol) != ""],
                                collapse = ",")) %>%
  mutate(hgnc_symbol = ifelse(hgnc_symbol == "", 
                              ensembl_gene_id,
                              hgnc_symbol)) %>%
  column_to_rownames("ensembl_gene_id") 

rownames(normalized_counts) <-
  ensembl_to_hgnc[ensembl_ids,]
```

Now that we fixed the gene names, let's look at the interactive heatmap using `InteractiveComplexHeatmap` package. Run below code in your notebook.

```{r}
# to create interactive heatmaps
library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)

ht_interactive <-
  Heatmap(scale2(normalized_counts[row_var > quantile(row_var, 0.99),]),
        show_row_names = TRUE, show_column_names = FALSE,
        clustering_distance_rows = "pearson", name = "gene expression",
        col = viridis::viridis(100), 
        top_annotation = ha, bottom_annotation = ha_bottom)

htShiny(ht_interactive)
```

# Project

For your project your goal is to describe the selected TCGA cohort:

* demographics (age, gender, and so on) - who were the patients whose data was analysed?
* survival data - what is the survival of this cancer?
* what are the subtypes identified in the analyses?
* somatic mutations - what are the most frequently mutated genes? what are the common mutations?
* gene expression - are there clearly visible patterns in gene expression? How does the expression of the highly mutated genes look like? 

Create a blogpost with description of your analysis, document your progress. Try to add interactivity to your visualizations. 

You will have to present the data to the rest of the hackathon groups at the end of this event. Prepare 10 minutes of showcasing the data, your visualizations.

This is the main project of this hackathon. From now on you will be working with your teams on your own and I will be available to guide you, answer your questions. You are expected to spend few hours each day working on this. 

Good luck! I'm already excited to see your data viz!
